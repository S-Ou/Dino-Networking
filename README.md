# Dino-Networking

Hi there! This project only requires two primary libraries to function (along with Python)


pyglet - `pip install pyglet`

NEAT - `pip install neat-python`

Optional libraries for logs:


graphviz - Must both `pip install graphviz` and download from graphviz.org, then type `dot -c` in cmd (Admin)

matplotlib - `pip install matplotlib`
